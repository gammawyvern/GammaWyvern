Hey, Iâ€™m Keagen Talsma! I'm a CS student at Grand Valley. 
I'm learning Rust right now, so watch out for a new text editor project.

Check out some of my code here:
- [Pytris]: A Tetris clone built in Python
- [CoreFisher]: An auto fishing script for the game Core Keeper in Python
- [Interactive Content]: More interactive style code for the web through Github Pages 
- [CIS350-Equalizer]: An equalizer built in .NET with NAudio 
- [Algorithms]: Assortment of smaller projects focused on algorithms
- [DataStructures]: Assortment of smaller projects focused on data structures

I'm at the point of just starting to understand how much I suck at coding.
Good thing I'm working hard to change that.
