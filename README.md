- Hey, I’m Keagen Talsma. I'm doing what I do.
- I know Java very well, and I'm efficient in Python as well.
- I like playing video games and listening to music.
- I'm working on learning Rust right now.

Check out some of my code here:
- [CIS350-Equalizer]: An equalizer built in .NET with NAudio 
- [CoreFisher]: An auto fishing script for the game Core Keeper in Python
- [Engineering]: Digital JLS circuits including building up to an ALU
- [DataStructures]: Assortment of smaller projects focused on data structures
- [Algorithms]: Assortment of smaller projects focused on algorithms
